# Common_Word_Finder
A local desktop application where you could find a specified number of the most common words in a text document in decreasing order (Most common first)
# Overview
An explanation of the Common Word Finder application, including its capabilities and how it functions.
## Purpose
I am working on improving my knowledge base and thought that creating a simple application with a GUI would be a good first step. 
## Code
Using the Java Swing library to develop a simple GUI for the program. You could drag or choose a txt file to get the specified number of the most common words from most common to least common. The CommonWordFinder class utilizes the hash map data structure to efficiently store and retrieve the frequency of a certain word. I first developed this class to be used from the command line, but then modified the class a little bit to function with a GUI. The command line version can select which data structure (AVL, BST, Hash) the program utilizes. All data structures were custom wrote using my understanding of these structures, and did not use the libraries for them.
